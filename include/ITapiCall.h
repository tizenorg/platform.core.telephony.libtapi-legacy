 /**
 * @brief This function originates MO call setup. This is an asynchronous function. The function completes immediately and
 * call setup proceeds in background.
 *
 * This API makes Dbus method call to Telephony Sever and gets immediate feedback.
 * However it just means that the API request has been transfered to the CP successfully.
 * The actual operation result is being delivered in the corresponding event asynchronously.
 *
 * @par Sync (TapiHandle *handle, or) Async:
 * This is an Asynchronous API.
 *
 * @par Important Notes:
 * - If call to tel_exe_call_mo(TapiHandle *handle, ) is successful, call handle and request ID are assigned by Telephony Server
 *   and returned to client by given Call Handle and Request Id parameters. MO call setup continues in
 *   background. There are multiple states involved in the call setup procedure. Upon request completion
 *   successful or not, various event notifications are sent to client along with data associated with event
 *   (TapiHandle *handle, Successful data or error information) based on the indication or response received at the Telephony Server.
 * - Setting up Emergency call
 *   - when #TelCallType_t is voice_call, voice call is setup unless dial_number parameter is an
 *   emergency number known to telephony FW (TapiHandle *handle, like 112 for all 2G and above, other numbers may operator
 *   specific or device configuration specific, so Telephony FW will read relevant SIM files and refer to internal
 *   configuration records). If an emergency number is passed and #TelCallType_t is voice_call, Telephony
 *   FW shall setup emergency phone call.
 *   - When #TelCallType_t is emergency call, emergency call is always set up.
